## Description

This Portfolio was created using React to utilize all the benefits that come with this JavaScript library, such as the use of components, props, and state to update the page without having to reload it at all. This helped make the page responsive and helped me write less code by allowing me to reuse code that were similar to eachother, but had different data to be displayed. Creating this portfolio helped me understand why React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries being used. It helped me get familiar with how and when to use the features mentioned before, and allowed me to explore and think of different ways this library can be used for, not only for this app, but many apps in the future.
