        I am a highly motivated and optimistic person with a passion for
        learning and a very strong work ethic. I have always been fascinated by
        how things around me work which led me to study biomedical sciences for
        my undergrad. This curiosity, as well as my constant use of technology,
        led me to teach myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
        fueled my decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp at the University of
        Toronto.

        During my time as a bootcamp student, I honed my skills and developed a
        strong foundation in web development. I am constantly seeking new
        opportunitie to continue to expand my knowledge and skills. Take a look
        at my the rest of my portfolio page to see some of the projects I have
        worked on. If you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration,
        don't hesitate to reach out.
